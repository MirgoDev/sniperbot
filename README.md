## 🧠 Sniperbot – MEV Sniping Smart Contract

### ⚡ Overview

**Sniperbot** is an Ethereum smart contract designed for MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategies such as **sniping** and **front-running**. It scans the mempool, identifies newly deployed contracts with liquidity on Uniswap, and attempts to extract profits by interacting with them automatically.
